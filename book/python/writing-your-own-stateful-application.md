# Writing Your Own Wallaroo Python Stateful Application

In this section, we will go over how to write a stateful application with the Wallaroo Python API. If you haven't reviewed the simple stateless application example yet, you can find it [here](writing-your-own-application.md).

## A Stateful Application - Alphabet

Our stateful application is going to be a vote counter, called Alphabet. It receives as its input a message containing an alphabet character and a number of votes, which it then increments in its internal state. After each update, it sends the new updated vote count of that character to its output.

As with the Reverse Word example, we will list the components required:

* Input decoding
* Output encoding
* Computation for adding votes
* State objects
* State change management

### StateComputation

The state computation here is fairly straightforward: given a data object and a state object, update the state with the new data, and return some data that tells Wallaroo what to do next.

```python
@wallaroo.state_computation(name='add votes')
def add_votes(self, data, state):
    state.update(data)
    return (state.get_votes(data.letter), True)
```

Let's dig into that tuple that we are returning:

```python
(state.get_votes(data.letter), True)
```

The first element, `state.get_votes(data.letter)`, is a message that we will send on to our next step. In this case, we will be sending information about votes for this letter on to a sink. The second element, `True`, is to let Wallaroo know if we should store an update for our state. By returning `True`, we are instructing Wallaroo to save our updated state so that in the event of a crash, we can recover to this point. Being able to recover from a crash is a good thing, so why wouldn't we always return `True`? There are two answers:

1. Your state computation might not have updated the state, in which case saving its state for recovery is wasteful.
2. You might only want to save after some changes. Saving your state can be expensive for large objects. There's a trade-off that can be made between performance and safety.

### State and StateBuilder

The state for this application is two-tiered. There is a vote count for each letter:

```python
class Votes(object):
    def __init__(self, letter, votes):
        self.letter = letter
        self.votes = votes
```

And a state map:

```python
class AllVotes(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.votes_by_letter = {}

    def update(self, votes):
        letter = votes.letter
        vote_count = votes.votes

        votes_for_letter = self.votes_by_letter.get(letter, Votes(letter, 0))
        votes_for_letter.votes += vote_count
        self.votes_by_letter[letter] = votes_for_letter

    def get_votes(self, letter):
        vbl = self.votes_by_letter[letter]
        return Votes(letter, vbl.votes)
```

This map is the `state` object that `AddVotes.compute` above takes.
An important thing to note here is that `get_votes` returns a _new_ `Votes` instance. This is important, as this is the value that is eventually passed to `Encoder.encode`, and if we passed a reference to a mutable object here, there is no guarantee that `Encoder.encode` will execute before another update to this object.

### Encoder
The encoder is going to receive a `Votes` instance and encode into a string with the letter, followed by the vote count as a big-endian 64-bit unsigned integer:

```python
@wallaroo.encoder
def encode(self, data):
    # data is a Votes
    return struct.pack(">IsQ", 9, data.letter, data.votes)
```

### Decoder

The decoder, like the one in Reverse Word, is going to use a `header_length` of 4 bytes to denote a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer. Then, for the data, it is expecting a single character followed by a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer. Here we use the `struct` module to unpack these integers from the bytes string.

```python
@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=">I")
def decode(self, bs):
    (letter, vote_count) = struct.unpack(">sI", bs)
    return Votes(letter, vote_count)
```

### Application Setup

Finally, let's set up our application topology:

```python
def application_setup(args):
    in_host, in_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_input_addrs(args)[0]
    out_host, out_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_output_addrs(args)[0]

    ab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder("alphabet")
    ab.new_pipeline("alphabet",
                    wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))
    ab.to_stateful(add_votes, AllVotes, "letter state")
    ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, encoder))
    return ab.build()
```

The only difference between this setup and the stateless Reverse Word's one is that while in Reverse Word we used:

```python
ab.to(reverse)
```

here we use:

```python
ab.to_stateful(add_votes, AllVotes, "letter state")
```

That is, while the stateless computation constructor `to` took only a computation class as its argument, the state computation constructor `to_stateful` takes a state computation _function_, as well as a state _class_, along with the name of that state.

### Miscellaneous

This module needs its imports:
```python
import struct

import wallaroo
```

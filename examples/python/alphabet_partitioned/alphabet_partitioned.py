"""
This is an example application that takes "votes" for different letters of the
alphabet and keeps a running total of the votes received for each letter. For
each incoming message, it sends out a message with the total votes for that
letter. It uses state partitioning to distribute the votes so that they can be
processed in parallel; the letter serves as the partitioning key, so, for
example, all votes for the letter "A" are handled by the same partition.
